A portable program made with your own hands can also be a simple or complex task.
-------------

There are some disadvantages to this method, but it is not possible to do it without them. After you have completed all the necessary actions for the program, the disadvantage lies in the name of the program itself. You can either change the executable file for the program or in the "App/AppInfo/Launcher/ program name.ini" startup settings. This is the only way to fix the startup issue. For complete peace of mind, we recommend using the [Total Uninstall](https://www.martau.com/) program. Through it, you can make the first impression of the program by finding the location of all its files and deleting anything that is not relevant to the program we are making portable. Follow the guides provided for this program yourself.
